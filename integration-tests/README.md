# Local RocketMQ integration environment

The `basic` profile provisions the pinned Apache RocketMQ 5.3.4 multi-platform
image. The image index digest is
`sha256:d57ee4ebbd9d7bb6e185775bde41c128e98f185b25bf0b05c77d4e6c010572b8`.
The Broker advertises the Compose service name `broker`, so clients must run on
the same Compose network. Host port mappings bind only to `127.0.0.1` and are
for diagnostics; they do not make the advertised Broker address host-routable.

The `two-broker-host` profile is for host-run Java and Rust clients that need
NameServer routes to both Brokers. It advertises `127.0.0.1:50911` and
`127.0.0.1:50921`, with the NameServer mapped to host port `19876` by default.
Set `ROCKETMQ_NAMESRV_HOST_PORT` before setup to select another unused loopback
port. It uses separate volumes from the Compose-network `two-broker` profile.
Since each Broker advertises a host loopback address, run topic and group admin
commands against each Broker's own loopback address from its matching service
container (`broker-a-host` or `broker-b-host`). The profile is still an
unmodified RocketMQ 5.3.4 topology; the host route mapping is test-only.

Provisioning requires an explicit disposable-test marker and profile:

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=basic \
bash integration-tests/setup.sh
```

The setup waits for NameServer and Broker health checks and then polls
`mqadmin clusterList` until `broker-a` is registered. Broker topic and
subscription-group auto-creation are disabled so scenarios must create their
own resources. Data is stored in a Compose-project-scoped volume.

Tear down only the matching local test project and its volume:

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=basic \
bash integration-tests/cleanup.sh
```

`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` may be set to isolate concurrent runs; it must start
with `rocketmq-classic-p19-`. Run one of the implemented live cases:

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=basic \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario ROUTE-001-get-existing-topic
```

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=basic \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario ROUTE-002-topic-not-exist
```

The TLS lifecycle handoff uses the isolated TLS profile:

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=tls \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario P3-V04
```

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=basic \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario HEARTBEAT-001
```

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=basic \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario PROD-001-sync-send
```

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=basic \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario PROD-002-async-send
```

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=basic \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario PROD-003-oneway-send
```

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=basic \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario PROD-004-batch-send
```

The runner creates a unique Compose project, provisions a manifest-owned
topic when required, then compares Java 5.5.1 and Rust route outcomes,
heartbeat bodies and Broker response versions, or synchronous/asynchronous/
oneway/batch send results, async completion counts, Broker queue offsets,
consumer-offset writes and cross-client queries, pull status/offsets/message
bodies, batch message bodies read by every returned physical offset ID,
bidirectional cross-language Broker readback, queue-lock acquisition,
contention and unlock release, live average queue assignment, and transaction
commit/rollback visibility through Java and Rust consumer pulls. `P6-V04`
checks live subscription changes, Broker-side tag filtering, producer
unregister, and continued use by the remaining producer. `P9-V03` covers
explicit pull statuses, suggested-broker selection, offset-boundary RPCs, and
resuming from a broker-persisted offset after a consumer restart.
`REQ-001-request-reply-success` checks Java request/Rust reply and Rust
request/Java reply on separate scenario-owned topics, including the correlated
reply fields and each responder's observed request.
`P3-V04` invokes a raw route on the local NameServer, then sends Java and Rust
RocketMQ requests through a locally generated TLS terminator that forwards to
the disposable plain Broker. Java 5.5.1 verifies the CA chain but accepts a
trusted wrong-host certificate; Rust verifies the host and rejects it. Both
clients reject an untrusted CA and report zero retained remoting resources at
shutdown. `P7-V04` uses two host-routed Brokers to send 20 messages in each of
three producer start/shutdown cycles and checks that pending requests,
connections, and task groups return to zero each time.
`PROD-005-send-timeout` delays each direct Broker response beyond the reviewed
100 ms deadline and verifies the timed-out sends were each committed once by
cross-language pull readback.
`P5-V02-producer` compares raw producer V1, V2, batch, reply V1/V2, and
end-transaction calls on the pinned Broker.
`P5-V02-consumer` compares raw pull and Lite pull, offset query/update,
consumer-list, send-back, and queue lock/unlock calls on the two-Broker profile.
The 5.3.4 extension case records matching unsupported Lite subscription and
POP responses. To exercise the successful Lite subscription and POP paths, run
the separate unmodified official RocketMQ 5.5.0 profile:

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
bash tests/differential/run-p5-lite-supplementary.sh
```

That runner pins the multi-platform 5.5.0 image digest and uses an isolated
Broker config with LMQ and multi-dispatch enabled. Clean run
`20261025T135033Z` passed matching Java/Rust Lite subscription and Lite POP
success. It archives its own results and does not change the mandatory 5.3.4
matrix or by itself establish production support. It removes its isolated
topics, containers, network, and volume after the run. Toolchain,
configuration, output, and cleanup evidence is stored under
`docs/compatibility/evidence/phase-19/`; a manifest row becomes `PASS` only
after comparison and cleanup both succeed. The runner implements 28 of 37
cases; 27 have passed and `P7-V04` awaits its first clean-source live run: the
two Phase 0 route cases, `P0-V03`, `P3-V04`,
`P5-V02-route`, `P5-V02-producer`, `P5-V02-consumer`, `P5-V02-extensions`,
`P6-V04`, `P7-V02`, `P9-V03`, `P13-V02`,
`ORDER-001-lock-unlock`, `REBAL-001-average-10q-3c`, `HEARTBEAT-001`,
`PROD-001-sync-send` through `PROD-004-batch-send`, `PROD-005-send-timeout`, and
`CONS-001-query-offset` through `CONS-004-update-offset`, plus
`TX-001-commit`, `TX-002-rollback`, and `REQ-001-request-reply-success`.
`--phase N` and `--all` fail closed when any selected case has no runner.

The two-Broker lock case can be replayed with:

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=two-broker \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario ORDER-001-lock-unlock
```

The two-Broker average rebalance scenario can be replayed with:

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=two-broker \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario REBAL-001-average-10q-3c
```

The local transaction visibility cases use the host-routed `transaction`
profile:

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=transaction \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario TX-001-commit
```

Run the rollback case by replacing the scenario ID with `TX-002-rollback`.
The checks compare Java/Rust transaction results and pulls; commit requires two
visible messages and rollback requires an empty queue.

The high-level producer overload matrix uses the host-routed profile:

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=host-routed \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario P7-V02
```

It checks sync, async, oneway, explicit-queue, selector, valid-batch, and
mixed-topic batch rejection behavior against the same isolated Broker.

The shared-runtime lifecycle check also uses the host-routed profile:

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=host-routed \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario P6-V04
```

It verifies that changing the consumer filter takes effect at the Broker and
that producer B remains functional after producer A unregisters.

The explicit pull and offset-resume checks use the same host-routed profile:

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
ROCKETMQ_PROFILE=host-routed \
tests/differential/run.sh --scenario P9-V03
```

They compare all four pull statuses, suggested broker ID, min/max/search
offsets, and the next offset after a new consumer instance starts.

Live runs require the pinned runner toolchains: Maven on JDK 27 and Rust 1.85.0,
matching the repository CI configuration.

The full local entry point is:

```bash
ROCKETMQ_CLASSIC_TEST_ENV=local-disposable \
bash integration-tests/run-local.sh --all
```

It records and runs all server-free gates first. It then checks every Phase 19
manifest row before starting any Docker resource. Missing scenario runners
produce a `BLOCKED` result with the missing IDs in the archived log; the full
matrix cannot report success until all IDs have passing evidence. Currently
27 of 37 live cases have passing evidence; nine remain without runners:
`P7-V03`, `P10-V03`, `P11-V03`, `P11-V04`, `P12-V03`,
`P14-V03`, `P15-V03`, `P16-V02`, and `P17-V02`. `P5-V02-extensions`
passed the 5.3.4 parity case with matching unsupported responses for Lite
subscription and Lite POP; positive Lite success-path coverage passed
separately on the official 5.5.0 image and is not part of the 5.3.4 manifest
count.
`P7-V04` has a runner but still needs a clean-source live run. The remaining
two-Broker cases, ACL/feature profiles, and a fresh
`run-local.sh --all` pass remain pending. The last full local run predates
several later runner additions and must be rerun against the current revision.
Starting a profile by itself does not mark a scenario passed.
