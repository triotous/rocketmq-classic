# ADR-0020: Map MessageQueueAssignment public methods

Status: Accepted

## Context

The pinned Java `MessageQueueAssignment` exposes bean getters/setters, `equals`, and `toString`. Rust had public fields and derived equality but no accessor pair, no Java-shaped text, and no method that represented Java's queue-only equality and its null-queue failure.

## Decision

Add idiomatic getters/setters, `Display` and `java_to_string`, and a typed `java_equals` method. The explicit equality method compares only `message_queue`, returns false for a null other value, returns true for the same object reference, and reports Java's null `messageQueue` dereference for distinct objects. Rust's derived `PartialEq` and `Hash` continue to compare all fields so Rust hash collections retain a lawful Eq/Hash pair.

## Evidence

Two actual Java 5.5.1 method cases cover default and populated accessors/text plus queue-only equality when mode and attachments differ, different queues, self/null/wrong-type inputs, and the null-queue exception. `assignment_methods_match_invoked_java_public_api` compares the Rust accessor values, `Display`, and explicit equality outcomes.

Current combined lookup fixture SHA-256: `0c9ccc65b6c95d28d90d8de1bbac000436fe4468f1e7ebace6449ca1cf25c8e2`.

Java `MessageRequestMode` inherits identity-based `Object.hashCode`, so its numeric hash changes across JVM runs and has no stable enum-value equivalent. Rust keeps standard `Hash`; reproducing Java's hash-bucket collision effects is not claimed. This closes the recorded accessor/equality/text cases only; the wider Phase 6 API/input audit remains open.

## Mutable attachments getter continuation

The pinned Java getter returns the same Map passed to `setAttachments()`. Direct Java mutation through `getAttachments()` is visible through the setter-held Map. Rust already exposed `attachments_mut()`; the new differential verifies the matching mutation through the DTO-owned `BTreeMap`. The Rust move setter does not preserve the caller-owned Java Map identity.

- Direct Java evidence and Rust differential: `assignmentMethodCases` in `fixtures/runtime/lookup.json`; `assignment_methods_match_invoked_java_public_api`.
- Oracle/test commit: `359ed253`; no implementation change was needed.
- Current aggregate `fixtures/runtime/lookup.json` SHA-256: `8b6dab97da3ebca80f494b07ebcc7b12da396d700587137e136ea8620ed8d972`.
- Full workspace/all-target tests, strict Clippy, pinned offline Maven verify, comparator/manifest22, formatting, and diff checks pass. Phase 6 remains PARTIAL and P6-V04 stays PENDING_PHASE_19.

## Mutable nested queue getter continuation

The pinned Java getter returns the same `MessageQueue` assigned with `setMessageQueue()`. Direct Java mutation through `getMessageQueue()` changes that queue object. Rust adds `message_queue_mut()` to borrow the DTO-owned nested queue mutably; the focused differential changes the queue id through that borrow and matches the Java fixture. The Rust move setter does not preserve the caller-owned object identity.

- Direct Java evidence and Rust differential: populated `assignmentMethodCases` entry in `fixtures/runtime/lookup.json`; `assignment_methods_match_invoked_java_public_api`.
- Oracle/test commit: `caff0e22`; implementation commit: `8fff4781`.
- Current aggregate `fixtures/runtime/lookup.json` SHA-256: `9cdbcae68d20569b3d0cfdbf774aaf4183a63430438d9e3d74e8ad2e64b863d1`.
- Full workspace/all-target tests, strict Clippy, pinned offline Maven verify, comparator/manifest22, formatting, and diff checks pass. Phase 6 remains PARTIAL and P6-V04 stays PENDING_PHASE_19.
