# Phase 7 Producer compatibility matrix

Oracle: pinned client `org.apache.rocketmq:rocketmq-client:5.5.1`, source commit
`efa1be59d6fc747ad220f036c86030f05f0419f9`; the production server baseline remains
5.3.4. Java source and offline fixtures use the pinned tag. No live Broker or
NameServer was contacted.

## Pinned source paths and call sites

All Java references below are read from the pinned commit above, not the newer
HEAD in the Java checkout.

| Java source | Methods and call sites checked | Rust mapping |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `client/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/client/producer/DefaultMQProducer.java` | `start`, `shutdown`, `fetchPublishMessageQueues`; default, explicit-queue, selector, oneway, and collection `send` overloads; wrapper dispatch to `sendDirect` / `sendByAccumulator`; `batch(Collection)`; producer setting getters/setters | `Producer::{start,shutdown,fetch_publish_message_queues}`; `send*` and `send_batch*`; `ProducerConfig` |
| `client/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/client/impl/producer/DefaultMQProducerImpl.java` | `start`, `shutdown`, `sendDefaultImpl`, `sendSelectImpl`, `sendKernelImpl`, `tryToFindTopicPublishInfo`, `selectOneMessageQueue`, `updateFaultItem`, `pickTopic`; sync/future/oneway mode branches and the `ServiceDetector.detect` callback | `Producer` lifecycle, route cache, `send`, `selector`, `fault`, and `detect_brokers`; the detector calls `MQClientApi::probe_broker` |
| `client/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/client/Validators.java`; `common/.../constant/PermName.java`; `common/.../topic/TopicValidator.java` | `checkGroup`, `checkMessage`, `checkTopic`, `checkTopicConfig`, `checkBrokerConfig`, `isSystemTopic`, `isNotAllowedSendTopic`; topic classification remains distinct from the send-forbidden check | Public `validation::{is_system_topic,validate_group,validate_message,validate_send_topic,validate_system_topic,validate_topic,check_topic_config,check_broker_config}`; Common `PermName` maps all eight Java constants and methods, including the string overload's Java integer parsing. `MQClientApi::{create_topic,update_broker_config}` maps topic permission validation and the Broker config RPC, including empty-properties no-op, UTF-8 properties body, configured VIP port offset, and Broker errors. Fixture `validatorsApi`, `permNameApi`, `permNameCases`, `permNameStringCases`, `topicPermissions`, and `brokerPermissions` in `fixtures/producer/core.json` had SHA-256 `8216bf9c1a66b57a61e88af448f61ab38dc84015ffd872ee340d68896d3ec9b5` at that slice; subsequent admin RPC fixture additions advanced it through `53f8d3ae387f5df155d0c10484815f3a71d00debafb70c82ed0912f3848bca2f` and `c20f4474d674bd4e0001f19c82fed8c5e2dfbe6f5c911ee6eade0fb1842c7cb0` to current SHA-256 `434a3fe8b1cba71732f41ccb710e601e0d8ce4cbcf196265695cef7641b90905`. `perm_name_*_match_the_pinned_java_fixture`, `pinned_java_producer_core_fixture_matches_defaults_and_validation`, and Core admin RPC tests compare the API, values, failures, request bytes and response paths. Collection sends still validate original elements before `batch::encode_prepared_batch` constructs the wire message. |
| `common/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/common/message/MessageClientIDSetter.java` | `createUniqID`, `setUniqID`, `getUniqID`, `getNearlyTimeFromID`, `getIPStrFromID`, `getIPFromID`, `getPidFromID`, `createFakeIP` | `UniqueIdGenerator::{create, set_if_missing}`, `Message::get_property`, and `unique_id::{get_nearly_time_from_id, get_ip_str_from_id, get_ip_from_id, get_pid_from_id, create_fake_ip}`. `uniqueIdHelpers.publicApi` reflects the public no-argument constructor, zero public fields, and all eight declared/callable public methods; `public_unique_id_helpers_match_the_pinned_java_fixture` pins those signatures and existing behavior checks cover IPv4/IPv6 fields and address text, near-time reconstruction relative to the selected month start, short/odd/invalid hex inputs, and fake-IP length. The stateless Java utility constructor is represented by the Rust `unique_id` namespace. Fixture SHA-256: `af16e63df4a3506daaf22162afdf7b52655861bbf0cffea072983a4dacfa25b6`. The Java fixture stores the near-time delta rather than an absolute epoch, so it remains stable across timezones and month rollovers. Month boundaries use the process-local timezone like Java `Calendar`; the differential passes in UTC and `TZ=Asia/Taipei`. |
| `common/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/common/message/MessageBatch.java` | Public `List<Message>` constructor, `generateFromList`, `encode`, `iterator`; inherited `Message` API | `MessageBatch::{new,new_nullable,generate_from_list,generate_from_list_nullable,encode}`, `IntoIterator` for owned/shared/mutable batches, and `Deref<Target = Message>`. Nullable adapters represent Java null collection/elements; constructor input remains unchecked and null failures occur at encode/iteration, while `generateFromList` rejects null/empty inputs. Invoked fixture and Rust tests cover four delay properties, retry topics, topic/wait-store mismatches, null inputs, exception classes/messages and compact encoding; Producer collection sends call `generate_from_list` before input mutation. |
| `client/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/client/impl/producer/TopicPublishInfo.java` | `ok`, queue-list/order/router-info/route/cursor getters and setters, filtered selection, previous-broker avoidance, reset, write-queue count, diagnostic text | public `TopicPublishInfo`; live queue-list, route-data, and cursor handles; `FaultStrategy` reads the retained per-info cursor |
| `client/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/client/latency/MQFaultStrategy.java`; `LatencyFaultToleranceImpl.java` | `selectOneMessageQueue`, `updateFaultItem`, `isAvailable`, `detectByOneRound`; `DefaultMQProducerImpl` supplies `ServiceDetector.detect` using `MQClientAPIImpl.getMaxOffset(endpoint, queue, timeoutMillis)` | `FaultStrategy` and producer-owned detector task; `MQClientApi::probe_broker` sends `GET_MAX_OFFSET` for queue 0 with `committed=true` and treats only a successful, valid offset response as reachability |

`TopicPublishInfo::from_snapshot` is an internal adapter from the shared runtime
route snapshot and has no Java public constructor equivalent. It is
crate-private so it does not expand the exported Producer API.
The implementation-only `ProducerQueueIndex::current`,
`TopicPublishInfo::snapshot`, and `TopicPublishInfoTable::{snapshot,keys}` are
also crate-private. Java exposes `ThreadLocalIndex.incrementAndGet/reset`, the
individual `TopicPublishInfo` state accessors, and live Map views; Rust uses
these snapshot/current helpers only for diagnostic text and internal runtime
route/topic enumeration.

Java callback overloads are represented by Rust future-mode methods as allowed
by the Phase 7 plan; future scheduling is selected by the caller's Tokio
runtime. Rust `Producer` is itself the implementation handle. Its
`default_mq_producer_impl()` and `default_mq_producer()` accessors return
borrowed references to that same owner, preserving Java's facade/implementation
identity without allocating a separate wrapper.

## `DefaultMQProducerImpl` declared-public surface review

The invoked Java fixture now records both public constructors and all declared
public method signatures on the pinned implementation class. The pinned artifact
has 2 public constructors and 82 declared public methods; the Rust inventory
regression pins the count and the presence of direct hook and state/table
accessors. This is a declaration inventory, not proof that every entrypoint's
inputs and branches are equivalent.

`pinned_java_producer_impl_method_names_have_phase_crosswalks` checks all 82
fixture signatures (61 distinct Java method names) against the Phase 7 and
owning Phase 14–17 matrices. This guards method-name inventory coverage only;
per-overload input, error and control-flow branches remain part of P18-V01.

| Java implementation entrypoints | Rust owner mapping | P18-V01 disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `start`, `start(boolean)`, `shutdown`, `shutdown(boolean)`, `send*`, queue selection, route refresh, fault updates, topic/admin queries | `Producer` lifecycle/send owner; route and RPC operations are mapped in this matrix and Phase 17 | The no-argument start/shutdown methods delegate with `true`; pinned `MQClientInstance.start()` invokes `start(false)` for its internal Producer, while client-factory teardown invokes `shutdown(false)` to avoid recursively stopping the factory. Rust models factory lifecycle once through `ClientRuntimeManager` and owner leases; these booleans remain internal lifecycle controls rather than public Producer settings. Producer lifecycle transition and start-failure cleanup tests cover the owner flow. Per-overload input/branch crosswalks for other raw helpers remain open. |
| `getPublishTopicList`, `isPublishTopicNeedUpdate(String)`, `updateTopicPublishInfo(String, TopicPublishInfo)` | `ProducerRuntime::{publish_topics,is_publish_topic_need_update,update_topic_publish_info}` plus the Producer-owned publish-info cache | Pinned `MQClientInstance` calls these methods to enumerate producer topics, decide whether an empty/missing route needs refresh, and publish accepted route snapshots back to the owning Producer. Rust uses the same owner flow through `ProducerRuntime`; tests cover configured/dynamic topic inventory, namespace wrapping, empty-route state, and subsequent route publication. These lifecycle callbacks do not add user Producer settings. |
| Implemented `MQProducerInner` methods: `checkListener`, `getCheckListener`, `checkTransactionState`, `isUnitMode`, plus the route methods above | `Producer::{transaction_check_listener,transaction_listener,is_unit_mode}`; `ProducerRuntime::transaction_processor` and the runtime's owned inbound dispatch; route callbacks above | The pinned interface declares seven methods; all seven are present on the 82-signature implementation inventory. Rust keeps inbound transaction dispatch under runtime ownership, while the two listener getters expose the registered callback handles. Transaction lifecycle, inbound check/no-listener behavior, topic inventory and route publication have Phase 14 / Phase 6 fixture and scripted coverage. This accounts for the Java interface methods without exposing a mutable implementation object. |
| `invokeMessageQueueSelector(Message, MessageQueueSelector, Object, timeout)`, `send(Message, MessageQueue[, timeout])`, `sendOneway(Message, MessageQueue)`, and selector send overloads | `Producer::invoke_message_queue_selector` plus `Producer::{send_to_queue*,send_with_selector*,send_future_with_selector*,send_oneway_with_selector}` | Rust's selector closure captures Java's `arg`. The standalone API passes a Java-equivalent selector message view with its configured namespace removed and returns the selected queue with the producer namespace applied. The invoked `implementationSelectorMessageSnapshot` fixture verifies Java passes a distinct `Message`, shares body/property references, copies topic/flag/properties, and leaves `transactionId` null; the Rust selector test verifies the same readable values and that the input remains unchanged. The Rust callback takes `&Message`, so its deep-owned snapshot has the same observable read behavior without exposing Java-style mutable aliases. The test also exercises an already-namespaced input. The standalone API does not send. Pinned Java `send(Message, MessageQueue, timeout)` validates the message and calls `sendKernelImpl` directly; `invokeMessageQueueSelector` does not require its selected queue to be an element of `TopicPublishInfo.messageQueueList`. Rust resolves the caller-selected Broker through the current route and preserves its queue ID. `invoke_message_queue_selector_returns_the_namespaced_queue_without_sending` covers selector inputs, the returned queue, null selection, timeout, and no send; `explicit_and_selected_queue_ids_outside_the_route_are_sent_to_the_routed_broker` covers explicit and selector sync/future/oneway sends using IDs 7–12 when the route advertises only ID 0; an unknown Broker still fails before a send attempt. Invoked Java `implementationSelectorFailure` exercises selector-only and sync send failures, including the wrapped FAQ message and cause; Rust catches selector panics as `ProducerError::SelectorPanicked` and verifies both fail before Broker I/O. Java's public method signature is pinned in `producerImplementationApi`. |
| `registerCheckForbiddenHook`, `hasCheckForbiddenHook`, `executeCheckForbiddenHook`; `registerSendMessageHook`, `hasSendMessageHook`, `executeSendMessageHookBefore`, `executeSendMessageHookAfter` | `Producer::{register_check_forbidden_hook,has_check_forbidden_hook,execute_check_forbidden_hook,register_send_message_hook,has_send_message_hook,execute_send_message_hook_before,execute_send_message_hook_after}`; send flows share the same snapshot runners | Direct helper behavior now has invoked Java fixture and Rust integration evidence for registration order, check rejection short-circuit, context mutation, and send-hook panic isolation. `send.rs` uses the same snapshot runners; broad overload/input reconciliation remains open. |
| `registerEndTransactionHook`, `hasEndTransactionHook`, `executeEndTransactionHook`, `doExecuteEndTransactionHook` | `Producer` end-transaction hook APIs and public context | Fixture-backed local, Broker-check, direct execution and trace cases are recorded above and in Phase 14. |
| `getTopicPublishInfoTable` | `Producer::get_topic_publish_info_table()` returns the shared `TopicPublishInfoTable`; entries are shared `TopicPublishInfo` values whose live queue-list, route-data, order/router-info flags, and cursor feed later route snapshots and send selection | Invoked Java fixture and Rust differential cover getter/map identity, put/get/replace/remove, retained value/list/route/cursor aliases, direct queue selection, write-queue count, and a scripted default send after queue-list mutation. The table methods now include `getOrDefault`, `putIfAbsent`, `containsValue`, conditional removal/replacement, all compute/merge variants, `forEach`, `replaceAll`, and ordered `putAll`; fixtures cover nullable key/value/callback/result behavior, including Java's null-conditional-remove and values-view-remove false results, partial `putAll`, and null `replaceAll` result. Retained key/value/entry views cover single/bulk mutation, `removeIf`, nullable inputs, and `Map.Entry.setValue`. Filtered queue selection covers null/empty varargs, a null filter (NPE only when a nonempty queue list evaluates it), null/empty queue lists, and non-short-circuit filter order. Current `fixtures/producer/core.json` SHA-256 `bfa2d5f8f411c4648670d024e44b0e637ab793873a9eeb0c7ff75bb2a82651c5`. These close bounded mapping slices only; broad P18-V01 remains open. |
| `getServiceState`, `setServiceState(ServiceState)` | `Producer::{service_state,set_service_state}`; public `ProducerServiceState` | The invoked Java fixture and Rust tests cover initial state, all four Java names/ordinals, null assignment, start failure, duplicate-group reset, normal start and shutdown transitions. |
| `getDefaultMQProducer`, `isUnitMode` | `Producer` itself owns the Java default-producer behavior; `Producer::config` and `Producer::is_unit_mode` expose its configuration view | Java identity/configuration and unit-mode values are captured in `implementationStateAccessors`; Rust verifies the same group and unit-mode value without adding a wrapper object. |
| `getMqFaultStrategy` | Producer fault settings are exposed through the direct live `Producer` getters/setters; `FaultStrategy::select` applies availability, reachability and previous-broker rules inside the owner | Pinned fixture inventories `MQFaultStrategy`'s 2 constructors, 16 declared/17 Java-visible public methods (including inherited `StartAndShutdown.start` and `preShutdown`), and `BrokerFilter`'s constructor and 2 methods. Source search shows `getAvailableFilter`, `getReachableFilter`, `getThreadBrokerFilter`, and `BrokerFilter` are used only by the strategy's own queue-selection method. Rust keeps the raw strategy/filter and Java `ThreadLocal` handles inside the Producer owner. Fault-array aliasing, toggles, selection and null/length failures have fixture/unit evidence; direct Java object access is an internal-entrypoint disposition, not a Rust raw-handle promise. |
| `getMqClientFactory`, deprecated `getmQClientFactory` | `ClientRuntime` owns shared runtime behavior; Producer, Core, consumer and admin APIs call the runtime for lifecycle, route, RPC, heartbeat, registration, rebalance and query work | Pinned fixture inventories the returned `MQClientInstance`'s 2 constructors and 51 Java-visible public methods. Producer call sites map client ID to runtime identity, route lookup/refresh to the shared route cache, heartbeat and send/transaction/recall operations to Core runtime APIs, NameServer validation to the shared client/transport, and callback/RPC-hook access to the owner remoting client. Cross-phase owner mappings are linked above and in Phases 6, 9–11, 13, 15–17. Rust intentionally does not return raw mutable `MQClientInstance`, `MQClientAPIImpl`, route/registry maps, executor, or Netty config handles; those remain owned by `ClientRuntime` and group owners. This closes the returned-surface disposition only; broad P18-V01 input/branch and reverse-export reconciliation remains open. |
| `executeAsyncMessageSend`, `getAsyncSenderExecutor`, `setAsyncSenderExecutor(ExecutorService)`, semaphore helpers | `AsyncSenderExecutor`, Producer runtime backpressure APIs and owned send lifecycle | Source review finds exactly three internal `executeAsyncMessageSend` call sites for the default, explicit-queue and selector async paths; its `BackpressureSendCallBack` parameter type is package-private. Rust keeps the raw `Runnable` helper internal and routes typed async sends through the owner executor/backpressure path. Submission, rejection, backpressure and deadline behavior are fixture/unit covered (`configured_async_sender_executor_runs_future_send_attempts`, `rejected_async_sender_executor_follows_java_backpressure_fallback`, `queued_async_sender_work_obeys_the_send_deadline`). This closes the raw-helper disposition only; broader overload/branch reconciliation remains open. |
| `initTransactionEnv`, `destroyTransactionEnv`, `checkTransactionState`, `endTransaction`, transaction sends | Phase 14 `TransactionProducer` and producer-owned transaction runtime | Transaction worker/lifecycle and request flows map in the Phase 14 matrix; broad overload/input reconciliation remains part of P18-V01. |
| `request*`, `recallMessage`, trace hooks | Phase 15 request/reply, Producer recall, and Phase 16 trace owners | Owner-level behavior is mapped in their phase matrices; inherited/helper overload and reverse-export reconciliation remains open. |

## Rust publish-info reverse crosswalk

The Java-side fixture guards Java method names against the phase matrices. The
reverse scan now has exact Rust-to-Java rows for all 17 public `TopicPublishInfo`
methods, its nested `QueueFilter.filter` method, all 3 public `ThreadLocalIndex`
methods, and the surfaced Rust adapters. Several Java owners are inherited
`Map`/`Collection` methods on the live table views. The guards
`pinned_java_topic_publish_info_surface_has_phase_crosswalks` and
`pinned_java_topic_publish_info_queue_filter_surface_has_phase_crosswalks`,
`pinned_java_thread_local_index_surface_and_format_match_rust`, and
`rust_publish_info_method_names_have_java_crosswalks` pin these source inventories
and require each listed Rust API and Java counterpart on the same matrix row.
The Java `ThreadLocalIndex` class is signature-pinned; its increment masking,
reset, and `toString()` behavior are compared with `ProducerQueueIndex`.
Rust-only `ptr_eq` methods were removed from the public surfaces of
`ProducerPublishQueueList`, `ProducerQueueIndex`, `TopicPublishInfo`, and
`TopicRouteDataHandle`; crate-internal identity checks remain for Java
map/view semantics. Producer/Core compile-fail doctests and mutation-
based integration assertions guard the external boundary and retained-alias
behavior.

| Rust public API | Java 5.5.1 API | Mapping note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TopicPublishInfo::is_order_topic` | `TopicPublishInfo.isOrderTopic()` | JavaBean getter for ordered-topic routing. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::set_order_topic` | `TopicPublishInfo.setOrderTopic(boolean)` | Updates the ordered-topic flag. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::ok` | `TopicPublishInfo.ok()` | True only when the queue list exists and is nonempty. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::message_queue_list` | `TopicPublishInfo.getMessageQueueList()` | Returns the retained live queue-list handle; `None` maps to Java null. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::set_message_queue_list` | `TopicPublishInfo.setMessageQueueList(List<MessageQueue>)` | Installs or clears the retained live queue-list handle. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::send_which_queue` | `TopicPublishInfo.getSendWhichQueue()` | Returns the retained cursor handle. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::set_send_which_queue` | `TopicPublishInfo.setSendWhichQueue(ThreadLocalIndex)` | Replaces the retained cursor handle. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::have_topic_router_info` | `TopicPublishInfo.isHaveTopicRouterInfo()` | JavaBean getter for route-data presence. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::set_have_topic_router_info` | `TopicPublishInfo.setHaveTopicRouterInfo(boolean)` | Updates route-data presence. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::select_one_message_queue` | `TopicPublishInfo.selectOneMessageQueue()` | Increment-first cursor selection; Rust returns typed errors for null/empty lists. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::select_one_message_queue_with_nullable_filters` | `TopicPublishInfo.selectOneMessageQueue(QueueFilter...)` | Preserves nullable varargs and nullable filter elements. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::select_one_message_queue_avoiding` | `TopicPublishInfo.selectOneMessageQueue(String lastBrokerName)` | Avoids the previous Broker when possible. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::reset_index` | `TopicPublishInfo.resetIndex()` | Resets the retained `ThreadLocalIndex`. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::get_write_queue_nums_by_broker` | `TopicPublishInfo.getWriteQueueNumsByBroker(String)` | Reads the Broker write-queue count from retained route data. |
| `Display for TopicPublishInfo` | `TopicPublishInfo.toString()` | Provides the pinned Java diagnostic string through Rust formatting. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::topic_route_data` | `TopicPublishInfo.getTopicRouteData()` | Returns the retained route-data handle; `None` maps to Java null. |
| `TopicPublishInfo::set_topic_route_data` | `TopicPublishInfo.setTopicRouteData(TopicRouteData)` | Installs or clears the retained route-data handle. |
| `PublishInfoQueueFilter<'_>` | `TopicPublishInfo.QueueFilter.filter(MessageQueue)` | Rust callback alias for the Java nested functional interface. |
| `NullablePublishInfoQueueFilters<'_>` | `TopicPublishInfo.selectOneMessageQueue(QueueFilter...)` | Represents nullable Java varargs and null filter elements. |
| `ProducerQueueIndex::increment_and_get` | `ThreadLocalIndex.incrementAndGet()` | Stores the wrapped `i32` value and returns `value & 0x7fffffff`; the fixture pins overflow from `i32::MAX` to `0`, then `1`. |
| `ProducerQueueIndex::reset` | `ThreadLocalIndex.reset()` | Replaces the current thread's cursor with a nonnegative random value. |
| `Display for ProducerQueueIndex` | `ThreadLocalIndex.toString()` | Preserves Java's `null` before the first initialization and formats the raw current `i32`. |
| `TopicPublishInfoTable::replace_all_with_nullable_callback` | `Map.replaceAll(BiFunction)` | Nullable callback adapter on the live `ConcurrentMap` counterpart. |
| `TopicPublishInfoKeySetView::remove_if_with_nullable_callback` | `Map.keySet().removeIf(Predicate)` | Nullable callback adapter on the live key view. |
| `TopicPublishInfoValuesView::remove_if_with_nullable_callback` | `Map.values().removeIf(Predicate)` | Nullable callback adapter on the live values view. |
| `TopicPublishInfoEntrySetView::remove_if_with_nullable_callback` | `Map.entrySet().removeIf(Predicate)` | Nullable callback adapter on the live entry view. |
| `TopicPublishInfoValuesView::remove_all_iter` | `Map.values().removeAll(Collection)` | Iterator input adapter to the inherited collection operation. |

This closes only these surfaced name crosswalks and ThreadLocalIndex overflow
formatting; Rust public API reverse export and Java overload/input/error/flow
reconciliation remain open under P18-V01.

## Pinned producer API and settings inventory

This inventory was checked against the pinned `DefaultMQProducer`,
`DefaultMQProducerImpl`, `Validators`, `MessageBatch`, `TopicPublishInfo`, and
`MQFaultStrategy` source. The high-level facade re-exports the public types
required to construct/configure a producer, including `CompressionType`.

The pinned Java facade inventory records 11 public `DefaultMQProducer`
constructors, 107 declared and 183 callable public methods (including
`ClientConfig`), 34 declared and 42 callable `MQProducer` methods (including
`MQAdmin`), and 8 `MQAdmin` methods. The Rust fixture test pins these counts
and representative inherited signatures. This fixes the reflection denominator;
it does not close the method-by-method P18-V01 mapping. In particular, Java's
public `sendDirect` can bypass auto-batching and `sendByAccumulator` can enqueue
an eligible message through the accumulator regardless of the wrapper's
`autoBatch` branch. Rust exposes direct-send and forced-accumulator owner
methods; the scripted regression below checks their sync/future, default/queue,
and live-setting behavior. Remaining overload/input/branch crosswalks still
belong to P18-V01.

The primary `rocketmq-classic` facade also re-exports the producer's Java-mapped
service state, default group, transaction hooks/context, query result, and the
`TopicPublishInfo` value/table/collection-view types and their Java collection
adapters. `tests/facade_public_types.rs` checks these root import paths and
exercises `Producer::service_state` and
`Producer::get_topic_publish_info_table`; this verifies facade reachability,
while the behavior mappings remain in this matrix and Phases 14 and 17.

The 11 facade constructor signatures are pinned individually by
`pinned_java_default_producer_facade_and_inherited_interfaces_are_recorded`.
`producerConstructorCases` invokes all 11 constructors and records group,
namespace, RPC-hook retention by both facade and implementation, initial topic
values, and trace settings. The Rust differential
`pinned_java_producer_constructor_values_map_to_rust_configuration` compares
those values with `ProducerConfig`/`ClientConfig`; an owner-level regression
also proves the supplied Rust RPC hook is retained. Invoked nullable cases
cover null producer group in constructors and the setter, namespaced null
groups, null namespace, null topic list, and enabled tracing with a null trace
topic. Public send, forbidden-check and end-transaction hook contexts preserve
their Java-null group fields as Rust `Option<String>` values. Rust preserves
nullable construction configuration through `ProducerConfig::new_nullable`,
its `producer_group() -> Option<&str>` getter and
`set_producer_group(Option<String>)`; `new` remains convenient for non-null
construction. The live `Producer` exposes an owned group snapshot and nullable
setter. Java start wraps the group with the
namespace and then rejects null as blank before creating a client factory. Rust
matches the exact error text and `START_FAILED` state for both namespaced and
un-namespaced null groups. Java retains its caller-owned topic `List`; Rust
owns topic values and snapshots the configured list at start. The Producer
getter reflects later setter calls, while the started runtime keeps using its
startup list, matching Java's `initTopicRoute()` read timing. Fixture SHA-256:
`1ed0060666e8ee2a6b5b82b3088b22cb41a9a690bc291a96e56e51d16e7f7d76`.

Their parameter-to-owner mapping is:

| Java `DefaultMQProducer` constructor | Java field effect | Rust construction mapping |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `()`; `(RPCHook)`; `(String producerGroup)`; `(String producerGroup, RPCHook)` | Default group is `DEFAULT_PRODUCER` when omitted; otherwise set the group; hook is null unless supplied | `ProducerConfig::new(DEFAULT_PRODUCER_GROUP)` or `ProducerConfig::new(group)`, then `Producer::new` or `Producer::new_with_rpc_hook` |
| `(String producerGroup, RPCHook, List<String> topics)` | Set group, hook and initial topic list; trace remains disabled | Set `ProducerConfig::producer_group` and `topics`; pass hook to `Producer::new_with_rpc_hook` |
| `(String producerGroup, boolean enableMsgTrace, String customizedTraceTopic)`; `(String producerGroup, RPCHook, boolean enableMsgTrace, String customizedTraceTopic)` | Set group, trace flag and optional trace topic; the second form also sets the hook | Set group, `ClientConfig::set_enable_trace` and `set_trace_topic`; pass the optional hook to `Producer::new_with_rpc_hook` |
| `(String producerGroup, RPCHook, List<String> topics, boolean enableMsgTrace, String customizedTraceTopic)` | Set group, hook, initial topic list and trace settings | Set `ProducerConfig` group/topics and `ClientConfig` trace settings; pass hook to `Producer::new_with_rpc_hook` |
| Deprecated `(String namespace, String producerGroup)`; `(String namespace, String producerGroup, RPCHook)` | Set legacy namespace and group; optional hook is retained | Set `ClientConfig::set_namespace` and Producer group; optional hook goes to `Producer::new_with_rpc_hook` |
| Deprecated `(String namespace, String producerGroup, RPCHook, boolean enableMsgTrace, String customizedTraceTopic)` | Set namespace, group, hook and trace settings | Set `ClientConfig` namespace/trace settings and Producer group; pass hook to `Producer::new_with_rpc_hook` |

Rust represents these Java overloads as configuration plus owner construction,
not matching constructor overloads. The table and fixture cover the constructor
field effects and listed null branches; untested malformed inputs and the
broader overload/source branch audit remain P18-V01 work.

| Java 5.5.1 source surface | Rust mapping | Evidence / scope |

| `send` sync overloads, `sendOneway`; explicit `MessageQueue` and `MessageQueueSelector` overloads | `Producer::{send,send_with_timeout,send_future,send_future_with_timeout,send_oneway,send_oneway_with_timeout,send_to_queue,send_to_queue_with_timeout,send_to_queue_future,send_to_queue_future_with_timeout,send_to_queue_oneway,send_with_selector,send_with_selector_with_timeout,send_future_with_selector,send_future_with_selector_with_timeout,send_oneway_with_selector}` take `&mut Message` to represent Java's caller-visible message preparation | Scripted cases cover retry, one-way, explicit queue, selector, and mode policy; `mode_specific_attempts_match_java_retry_budgets`, `sync_retries_configured_broker_codes_while_future_retries_transport_only`, `per_request_timeout_only_limits_sync_attempts_that_have_a_retry_after_them`, `zero_per_request_timeout_retries_sync_attempts_within_total_budget`, and `default_sync_send_retries_check_forbidden_hook_errors_like_java`. The pinned `perRequestTimeoutRetry` fixture proves a local zero-cap timeout still consumes the configured retry budget while total time remains; `checkForbiddenRetry` proves Java repeats CheckForbidden after a synchronous hook exception without reaching send hooks or RPC. Rust futures are polled on the caller-selected Tokio runtime, replacing callback methods while preserving the mode-specific send/result flow. Direct sends write `UNIQ_KEY` back after route/address resolution and before the first send attempt, so retries reuse it. |
| Public `sendDirect` / `sendByAccumulator` helper paths | `Producer::{send_direct,send_direct_with_timeout,send_direct_future,send_direct_future_with_timeout,send_to_queue_direct,send_to_queue_direct_with_timeout,send_to_queue_direct_future,send_to_queue_direct_future_with_timeout,send_by_accumulator,send_by_accumulator_future,send_to_queue_by_accumulator,send_to_queue_by_accumulator_future}` | Pinned source confirms `sendDirect` always calls the underlying send path, while `sendByAccumulator` validates and writes `UNIQ_KEY` to the caller message before dispatching eligible individual messages. `direct_and_forced_accumulator_helpers_keep_java_path_choices` checks sync/future and default/selected-queue paths against scripted transport, including bypass with auto-batch enabled and forced accumulation with it disabled. `sendInputMutation` records accumulator mutation and direct service-state failure before mutation on an unstarted Java producer; `accumulator_send_mutates_caller_before_runtime_dispatch_like_java` compares both outcomes, valid ID layouts, and caller topic. `autoBatchEligibility` and `auto_batch_eligibility_matches_java_direct_send_fallbacks` cover ineligible direct fallback. |
| `send(Collection<Message>, ...)`, `MessageBatch`, `batch(Collection)` | `Producer::{send_batch,send_batch_with_timeout,send_batch_future,send_batch_future_with_timeout,send_batch_to_queue,send_batch_to_queue_with_timeout,send_batch_to_queue_future,send_batch_to_queue_future_with_timeout}` take mutable message slices so caller-visible ID and namespace changes match Java; `batch::encode_prepared_batch`; public `MessageBatch::{new,generate_from_list,encode}` and `IntoIterator` | `message_batch_public_api_matches_java_551` pins the Java constructor/method signatures; `message_batch_generate_from_list_matches_java_validation_order` checks validation and inherited metadata; `batch_record_bytes_match_pinned_java_message_decoder_fixture` compares `MessageBatch::encode` bytes and iteration count to the pinned fixture; `collection_send_mutates_batch_messages_before_dispatch_like_java` compares Java's batch-preparation wrapper message, structural rejection before mutation, per-element validation's partial mutation boundary, aggregate-size versus lifecycle-check ordering, caller-visible IDs/topics, and the unstarted dispatch failure with the invoked Java fixture. The low-level `encode_prepared_batch` encoder itself leaves borrowed inputs unchanged and defers aggregate-size validation to the send path. This closes the MessageBatch public declaration and send-mutation slices only; broad P18-V01 remains open. |

Rust tests check detached `ProducerConfig` snapshots, changing default-topic fields in a later send header, send deadline changes, retry attempt count and retry-after-store-status behavior, and live message-size validation. See `runtimeSettings` in `fixtures/producer/core.json` and `runtime_default_topic_settings_reach_later_send_headers`, `runtime_send_timeout_applies_to_later_default_send`, `mode_specific_attempts_match_java_retry_budgets`, `runtime_non_ok_store_retry_switches_brokers_on_later_sends`, and `runtime_message_size_limit_applies_to_later_validation`. |
| `getProducerGroup()`, `setProducerGroup(String)` and subsequent send/hook headers, including null | `Producer::{producer_group,set_producer_group}`; send and end-transaction header group fields are optional | `runtimeSettings` in `fixtures/producer/core.json`; `producer_group_setter_updates_later_send_headers_including_null`; nullable V1/V2 and end-transaction header tests | UNIT_VERIFIED for live getter/setter behavior and Java's omission of null group fields on the wire; full overload/input audit remains open |
| `setSendMessageWithVIPChannel` and later sends | `Producer::{send_message_with_vip_channel,set_send_message_with_vip_channel}`; `ProducerConfig` supplies the startup value to the shared runtime | `runtimeSettings`; `vip_channel_setter_after_start_only_changes_getter_not_runtime_config`; Maven fixture verification; Java 5.5.1 `MQClientManager.getOrCreateMQClientInstance` clones `ClientConfig` before constructing `MQClientInstance` | UNIT_VERIFIED for pre-start configuration and Java's post-start split: the Producer getter reflects later changes, while sends and shared-runtime admin/detector calls keep using the startup ClientConfig snapshot. |
| `setTopics` during Producer lifetime | `Producer::{topics,set_topics}` with a startup topic snapshot for runtime registration | `runtimeSettings`; `topic_setter_after_start_changes_getter_but_not_runtime_topics`; Maven fixture verification | UNIT_VERIFIED for startup-list capture and post-start setter visibility without changing the started runtime topic set |
| `setBackPressureForAsyncSendNum/Size` at runtime | `Producer::{backpressure_async_send_num,set_backpressure_async_send_num,backpressure_async_send_size,set_backpressure_async_send_size}` plus construction-time `ProducerConfig` setters | Java adjusts live semaphore permits using the in-flight count. Rust's fair `AdjustableSemaphore` preserves in-flight count across resizing and clamps to Java minima. Invoked Java fixture records 7 held permits becoming 5 available after resizing 1024→12, then 12 after completion; `runtime_resize_preserves_in_flight_count_like_the_java_fixture` compares these outcomes. |
| `is/setEnableBackpressureForAsyncMode` at runtime | `Producer::{enable_backpressure_for_async_mode,set_enable_backpressure_for_async_mode}` plus construction-time config | The Java `runtimeSettings` fixture directly checks the mutable getter/setter. `producer_runtime_backpressure_settings_update_live_limits_and_mode` checks that later sends observe toggles and that already admitted sends retain their permits. |
| `getRetryResponseCodes()` live set / `addRetryResponseCode(int)` | `Producer::retry_response_codes` returns `RetryResponseCodes`, a shared live handle; `Producer::add_retry_response_code`; config getter returns the same handle | Java fixture mutates the returned set, mutates it through `addRetryResponseCode`, then removes through the retained set. Rust `producer_retry_response_codes_are_live_for_sync_retry_decisions` checks those mutations affect subsequent retry decisions; config clones remain independent snapshots. |
| `setBackPressureForAsyncSendNum/SizeInsideAdjust` and count/size read-lock helpers | Producer `*_inside_adjust` setters update the reported values directly; `acquire_backpressure_for_async_send_{num,size}_lock` returns `BackpressureReadGuard`, released by drop | The Rust APIs preserve the Java helper semantics while the fair limiter owns its internal state. `runtime_resize_waits_for_a_public_read_lock_guard` checks setters wait for a held public guard; `producer_runtime_backpressure_settings_update_live_limits_and_mode` covers both raw adjustment setters. |
| `setCallbackExecutor` | `Producer::set_callback_executor(Option<Arc<dyn CallbackExecutor>>)` forwarded to the started shared `RemotingClient` | The producer fixture confirms Java's pre-start null dereference; Rust reports `ProducerError::NotStarted` before start. A configured executor is retained by the shared client, and `None` restores its default callback executor. The facade re-exports `CallbackExecutor`. |
| `setAsyncSenderExecutor`, `DefaultMQProducerImpl.getAsyncSenderExecutor` / `executeAsyncMessageSend` | `Producer::{set_async_sender_executor,async_sender_executor}` and `AsyncSenderExecutor` / `AsyncSenderTask` | `fixtures/producer/core.json` directly checks Java's stable default, custom executor retention and null reset. Rust future-mode send attempts use the effective executor; rejection returns `AsyncSenderExecutorRejected`, while enabled async backpressure runs a rejected task inline, matching Java. Queued work observes the send deadline and retains its permits until it completes. Once submitted, a send continues if its result future is dropped, matching Java's callback submission lifetime. With no custom executor, Rust dispatches on the caller's Tokio runtime; it does not recreate Java's private fixed-size thread pool. The facade re-exports the executor trait and task alias. |
| `get/setCompressType`, `getCompressor` | `Producer::{compressor,set_compress_type}` returns a `ProducerCompressor` snapshot with `compress`/`decompress`; `ProducerConfig` keeps its construction-time setting | The Java fixture invokes all three compressor types, records their concrete class and round-trip result, and checks that an earlier compressor object keeps its type after `setCompressType`. Rust `producer_compressor_snapshot_and_operations_match_java_fixture` checks all types and runtime replacement. |
| `get/setCompressMsgBodyOverHowmuch`, `get/setCompressLevel` at runtime | `Producer::{compress_threshold,set_compress_threshold,compress_level,set_compress_level}`; config accessors remain available before construction | `runtimeCompressionSettings` directly updates Java, checks the threshold boundary and distinct ZLIB outputs at levels 1/9. Rust `runtime_compression_settings_match_java_and_config_clones_are_snapshots` verifies subsequent compression behavior, getters, and detached config-clone values. Java applies both settings to later sends without range validation. |
| `is/setSendLatencyFaultEnable`, `get/setLatencyMax`, `get/setNotAvailableDuration`, and `is/setStartDetectorEnable` at runtime | `Producer::{send_latency_fault_enable,set_send_latency_fault_enable,latency_max_millis,set_latency_max_millis,not_available_duration_millis,set_not_available_duration_millis,start_detector_enable,set_start_detector_enable}`; public `ProducerLongArray::{is_null,get,set,len,is_empty}` represents a nullable Java `long[]` and preserves shared mutation | `runtimeFaultStrategy` and `runtimeFaultStrategyNullArrays` in `fixtures/producer/core.json` cover input-array/getter aliases, live mutation, replacement, enable toggles, subsequent Broker selection, null setter/getter behavior, deferred null-table NPE, short-duration AIOOBE and ignored extra entries. `runtime_fault_strategy_null_and_mismatched_arrays_match_java` and `runtime_detector_toggle_skips_disabled_due_work_and_joins_on_shutdown` cover the Rust behavior. Maven fixture verification passes; current fixture SHA-256 `2f8c6d40c4669a6a662085e8cddef749338c91fcbb1bf64829ef1f59f77a284e`. |
| `initProduceAccumulator`, `getAutoBatch()`, `setAutoBatch(boolean)` | `Producer::{init_produce_accumulator,auto_batch,set_auto_batch}`; `Producer::start` initializes the accumulator at the Java startup point | The Java lifecycle fixture checks the pre-initialization false getter, initialization, and runtime toggles. Rust `producer_auto_batch_getter_and_setter_follow_accumulator_lifecycle` checks accessor behavior; `auto_batch_flushes_one_message_batch_and_fans_out_results` toggles batching after start and verifies the later direct-send path. |
| `request*`, `sendMessageInTransaction`, admin/query/recall, trace/namespace/security | Later phase APIs | Request/reply Phase 15; transaction Phase 14; admin/query Phase 17; namespace/security/trace Phase 16. These are intentionally not claimed as Phase 7 deliverables. |

The reverse inventory found the facade's compression setting type was not
reachable from `rocketmq-classic`; `CompressionType` is now re-exported by both
producer and facade crates and is used directly by the facade example. The
Rust-only `remove_retry_response_code` operation corresponds to removal from
Java's live `getRetryResponseCodes()` set; public validation functions map the
Java `Validators` entry points. Private scripted transport seams remain
test-only.

The re-exported `CompressionType::{find_by_value,get_compression_flag}` map to
Java `CompressionType.findByValue` and `getCompressionFlag`; the enum's values,
names, ordinals, and formatting are covered by the Phase 6 compression API
entry.

The complete public `ProducerConfig` accessor surface is grouped above by its
Java property, including `set_tls_config`/`tls_config` for the shared TLS
configuration adapter. Its API and fixture values are covered by the named
configuration tests; inherited `ClientConfig` accessors are audited in the
Phase 6 API/config map.

Exact producer configuration methods in that mapping are `new`,
`client_config`/`client_config_mut`, `tls_config`/`set_tls_config`,
`producer_group`/`set_producer_group`, `create_topic_key`/`set_create_topic_key`,
`topics`/`set_topics`,

`total_batch_max_bytes`/`set_total_batch_max_bytes`,
`enable_backpressure_for_async_mode`/`set_enable_backpressure_for_async_mode`,
`backpressure_async_send_num`/`set_backpressure_async_send_num`, and
`backpressure_async_send_size`/`set_backpressure_async_send_size`.

`ProducerConfig` is a pre-start builder, so its accumulator accessors expose
the configured values as `Option`s. The pinned Java API has a getter/setter
name mismatch for `totalBatchMaxBytes`: `totalBatchMaxBytes(value)` sets the
accumulator-wide hold cap, but `getTotalBatchMaxBytes()` returns the per-batch
hold size, matching `getBatchMaxBytes()`. The fixture records both that getter
result and the actual aggregate hold cap; Rust's `accumulator_settings()` maps
the setter's effect to the aggregate hold limit. The public Rust
`ProducerConfig::total_batch_max_bytes()` accessor mirrors that getter by
returning the configured per-batch value; `set_total_batch_max_bytes()` remains
the input for the aggregate cap consumed by the private accumulator settings.

| Producer shutdown after a live group change; request/reply pending state | `Producer::shutdown` looks up the current nullable group and removes that registry key; by-group removal leaves pending replies intact | Pinned Java `ProducerLifecycleFixtures` plus `producer_shutdown_matches_java_pending_request_and_timeout_scanner_state` cover unchanged, missing, another Producer's, and null groups, service state, pending-entry retention, callback count, and scanner stop. Java sets `SHUTDOWN_ALREADY` only after successful unregister; a null group throws first and leaves it RUNNING. `RequestFutureHolder.shutdown` leaves pending entries and callbacks alone. Fixture `fixtures/producer/lifecycle.json` SHA-256 `9d5063e8ae538f7da3f957c874dfb95dd81a6a85bf113a947a796de1815001d8`. This describes the public Producer path; low-level identity `GroupLease` cleanup remains a Rust lifecycle helper. |
| Default-route selection, sync/future/oneway, explicit queue and selector send APIs | `Producer` send methods | Implemented; five scripted TCP loopback tests cover route fallback, sync/future/oneway, queue/selector/batch sends, retries, auto-batch unit behavior and lifecycle | UNIT_VERIFIED for control flow and scripted transport |
| Missing Broker publish address after a writable queue is cached | Default send retries and explicit queue/selector send paths | Pinned Java `missingBrokerAddressRetry` clears the Broker address table after installing a valid publish route; `missingBrokerAddressExplicit` verifies the direct kernel error. Rust `default_send_missing_broker_addresses_matches_java_retry_error`, `explicit_queue_missing_broker_address_matches_java_error`, `selector_send_missing_broker_address_matches_java_error`, and `oneway_sends_once_and_unknown_explicit_broker_fails_before_io` preserve the writable queue when master ID `0` has a null address. Default exhaustion returns the Java client-error wrapper with response code `10003`, attempts and Broker list; direct queue/selector errors retain `The broker[broker] not exist`. Route request counts confirm the existing cached publish information is rechecked without another NameServer fetch.

Rust regressions compare attempt count, broker list, cause, response code and no-RPC/no-send-hook behavior. Default future errors also update the reachable-client fault entry when latency-fault mode is enabled. | UNIT_VERIFIED for these sync/default-future/explicit-future rejection branches; broad P18-V01 input/branch reconciliation remains open |
| Timeout after a Broker stores a message but before its acknowledgement reaches the client | `send` retry loop | Scripted two-Broker regression records the received request and drops its first acknowledgement; compatibility consequence documented below | UNIT_VERIFIED; both Broker peers received the unchanged body and unique ID |

## Compatibility consequence

A timeout does not establish whether the Broker stored the message. The sync
retry loop can submit the same prepared body and unique ID to another Broker;
applications can therefore observe duplicate delivery. The Producer does not
provide exactly-once delivery.

## Remaining inventory and case ownership

The Phase 7 send-settings inventory is split between `ProducerConfig`
construction-time values and `Producer` runtime setters, with the Java callback paths represented by Rust futures on the caller's Tokio
runtime. Java's configurable callback executors have no per-producer Rust
setting; scheduling follows the caller's runtime. Transaction and request/reply
operations belong to later phases. Namespace, security and tracing integration
remain assigned to Phase 16.

- **P7-V01:** UNIT_VERIFIED for captured producer and initialized accumulator
  defaults, validation boundaries, compression thresholds, message size and
  batch size cases.
- **P7-U01:** UNIT_VERIFIED using both private scripted transport and the five
  TCP loopback cases in `scripts/phase7-producer-scripted-tests.sh`: two-broker
  retry, response policy, oneway, explicit queue/selector/batch modes, body/ID
  preservation, and lost-ack duplicate delivery. All five loopback cases passed.
- **P7-V02–V04:** PENDING_PHASE_19, as specified by the plan. Do not mark them
  passed before the Docker server 5.3.4 handoff.

The producer detector's local probe adapter has direct scripted RPC coverage
for the queue-0 request fields, Broker error response, and missing/invalid
`offset` response branches. This is covered by
`producer_broker_probe_matches_get_max_offset_request_and_response_validation`
in `crates/rocketmq-classic-core/tests/rpc.rs`: the peer verifies GET_MAX_OFFSET,
topic, queue ID 0, and `committed=true`, and the test checks valid, Broker-error,
missing-offset, and invalid-offset outcomes. The focused test passes. This local
check does not change P7-V02–V04's Phase 19 live Broker status.

The dedicated offline Java producer fixture generator and its drift verification
pass. `mvn -f compat/java-reference/pom.xml verify` also passed, including the
runtime-config loopback fixture and Java decoding of Rust-generated fixtures.

## P18-V01 producer facade reverse-scan follow-up

The pinned `ProducerCoreFixtures.producerFacadeApi()` reflection inventory
records `DefaultMQProducer` (107 declared / 183 callable methods), `MQProducer`
(34 declared / 42 callable methods), and `MQAdmin` (8 methods). The Rust test
`pinned_java_default_producer_facade_and_inherited_interfaces_are_recorded`
pins the declaration and callable counts. The regression
`pinned_java_producer_callable_method_names_have_phase_crosswalks` checks every
callable method name across the 183 `DefaultMQProducer`, 42 `MQProducer`, and 8
`MQAdmin` signatures against the owning Phase 6/7/14–17 matrices, including
inherited `ClientConfig` and `MQAdmin` methods. Re-export-aware Rustdoc scanning
found no unmatched inherent Producer method names. The exact Java-token scan
produced the following naming candidates; each was checked against its owner
API and the evidence rows above. These are JavaBean/fluent names whose Rust
equivalents use property-oriented accessors, units, futures, or ownership
guards:

The pinned facade inventory contains 20 `send` overloads and 3 `sendOneway`
overloads on both `DefaultMQProducer` and `MQProducer`; the six `request`
overloads are tracked separately in the Phase 15 matrix. Their behavior groups
map as follows:

| Java overload family | Rust owner methods | Local evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default-route `send(Message[, timeout])`, sync and callback forms | `send`, `send_with_timeout`, `send_future`, `send_future_with_timeout`; Java callbacks are represented by future-mode sends | `default_topic_route_fallback_and_async_mode_response_policy_match_java`; `sync_send_retries_across_two_brokers_and_preserves_one_prepared_message`; callback executor submission/lifetime/rejection/deadline tests |
| Explicit-queue `send(Message, MessageQueue[, timeout])`, sync and callback forms | `send_to_queue*`, `send_to_queue_future*` | `public_queue_selector_and_batch_modes_use_the_scripted_route`; `explicit_and_selected_queue_ids_outside_the_route_are_sent_to_the_routed_broker` |
| Selector `send(Message, MessageQueueSelector, arg[, timeout])`, sync and callback forms | `send_with_selector*`, `send_future_with_selector*` | `public_queue_selector_and_batch_modes_use_the_scripted_route`; `invoke_message_queue_selector_returns_the_namespaced_queue_without_sending`; `explicit_and_selected_queue_ids_outside_the_route_are_sent_to_the_routed_broker` |
| `sendOneway(Message)`, explicit-queue and selector overloads; Rust also provides timeout-taking variants | `send_oneway*`, `send_to_queue_oneway`, `send_oneway_with_selector` | `public_queue_selector_and_batch_modes_use_the_scripted_route`; `oneway_sends_once_and_unknown_explicit_broker_fails_before_io` |
| `send(Collection<Message>[, timeout])` and explicit-queue collection overloads, sync and callback forms | `send_batch*`, `send_batch_future*`, `send_batch_to_queue*`, `send_batch_to_queue_future*`; callback forms use future mode. Collection-send APIs take `&mut [Message]` to preserve Java's per-element unique-ID and namespace mutation before dispatch; batch-preparation failures map to `BatchInitiationFailed` with Java's wrapper message, while aggregate-size validation follows producer-state validation. Explicit and auto-batch paths share `encode_prepared_batch`. | `public_queue_selector_and_batch_modes_use_the_scripted_route` exercises default/queue and sync/future with and without an explicit timeout; `collection_send_mutates_batch_messages_before_dispatch_like_java`; `batch_body_matches_message_decoder_record_layout_and_does_not_mutate_inputs` covers the low-level encoder; `encoded_batch_size_is_checked_by_send_validation` |
| Implementation `sendDirect` and `sendByAccumulator` paths | `send_direct*`, `send_to_queue_direct*`, `send_by_accumulator*`, `send_to_queue_by_accumulator*` | `direct_and_forced_accumulator_helpers_keep_java_path_choices` directly calls all 12 public helpers, checks sync/future mode, default/selected queue and bypass/forced-batch decisions under both `autoBatch` settings |

The Rust source-level reverse check found all 37 public send methods directly
referenced by Producer crate test targets. The updated scripted tests assert
all 16 generated route requests, including seven batch sends and three oneway
sends; the forced/direct helper test asserts twelve attempts. Java callback
overloads map to Rust futures, with executor submission, cancellation,
rejection, and deadline behavior covered by the named executor tests. The
inherited `MQAdmin` methods map to all three client facades in the Phase 17
matrix; transaction and namespace/security/trace owners are mapped in Phases
14 and 16.

This closes the reviewed Producer facade token-scan candidates and the bounded
callable method-name reverse scan only. It does not close per-overload
input/error/control-flow crosswalks, the full Rust public API reverse export,
or whole-client source/input reconciliation required by P18-V01.

## P18-V01 `Validators` permission methods and broker config RPC — 2026-10-21

Pinned Java `Validators` declares seven public methods, including
`checkTopicConfig(TopicConfig)` and `checkBrokerConfig(Properties)`. The former
accepts permissions 0 through 7 and throws `MQClientException` code 16 for
other values. The latter is a no-op when `brokerPermission` is absent, parses
the present value with `Integer.parseInt`, and then applies the same 0 through
7 range check. Rust exposes these checks as `validation::check_topic_config`
and `validation::check_broker_config`; `PermName` maps the Java masks, tests,
string overload and public constants.

`MQClientApi::create_topic` validates an explicitly supplied `perm` before
network I/O. `MQClientApi::update_broker_config` validates before encoding,
returns without RPC for an empty map, sends non-empty values as UTF-8
`key=value\n` lines with request code 25 and no header fields, applies the
configured Java VIP port offset, and preserves Broker response errors. Invalid
permissions format the same code-16 `MQClientException` message, while
malformed strings retain Java's `NumberFormatException` input text. The pinned
Java fixture records all seven `Validators` signatures, all eight `PermName`
signatures and public fields, numeric/string permission inputs, and the
validation outcomes. Fixture SHA-256:
`8216bf9c1a66b57a61e88af448f61ab38dc84015ffd872ee340d68896d3ec9b5`.
Common permission differentials, Producer fixture comparisons and scripted
Core admin RPC tests cover the values and branches listed above. This closes
these bounded APIs and operation paths only; broad P18-V01 and the final
current-revision P18-V02 refresh remain open.
