# Phase 18 Offline Benchmark Baseline

Captured with `cargo bench -p rocketmq-classic --bench offline --locked` on
2026-10-13 at revision `a8c510d1cbc7`. These are local baseline observations,
not performance thresholds. They describe this machine and toolchain only.

## Environment

- OS and architecture: macOS, AArch64
- CPU: Apple M5 Max, 18 logical CPUs
- Rust: `rustc 1.85.0 (4d91de4e4 2025-02-17)`
- Profile: optimized release benchmark profile
- Fixed inputs: checked-in compressed-message fixture, fixed Remoting command,
  fixed 512-byte message body, 128-entry route table, and local plain-TCP
  request/response peer

## Results

| Operation | Input | Iterations | Time per iteration | Allocation calls per iteration | Allocated bytes per iteration |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Remoting frame encode/decode | 427 encoded frame bytes | 20,000 | 1,943.6 ns | 39.00 (1,000 samples) | 4,612.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Zstd message-record decode | 146 record bytes | 10,000 | 1,250.8 ns | 20.00 (1,000 samples) | 197,407.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Producer send-request construction | 512-byte body | 20,000 | 990.7 ns | 43.00 (1,000 samples) | 3,247.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Publish-address lookup | 10-byte key, 128 route entries | 100,000 | 15.2 ns | 0.00 (1,000 samples) | 0.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Loopback pending-request completion | 128-byte body over local TCP | 500 | 62,282.0 ns | 77.00 (100 samples) | 9,234.0 (100 samples) |

Allocation figures are aggregate allocator calls and requested bytes divided by
the number of sampled operations; they are not retained-heap measurements.
The loopback result includes local TCP and Tokio scheduling. Repeat measurements
on the same host before comparing revisions. This baseline sets no acceptance
threshold.

## Final current-revision rerun

Captured with the same command and environment on 2026-10-13 at revision
`97e27ff9`. This rerun includes the TopicValidator nullable-input change; its
benchmarks do not target TopicValidator. The results remain machine-specific
observations.

| Operation | Input | Iterations | Time per iteration | Allocation calls per iteration | Allocated bytes per iteration |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Remoting frame encode/decode | 427 encoded frame bytes | 20,000 | 1,999.9 ns | 39.00 (1,000 samples) | 4,612.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Zstd message-record decode | 146 record bytes | 10,000 | 1,282.7 ns | 20.00 (1,000 samples) | 197,407.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Producer send-request construction | 512-byte body | 20,000 | 1,077.6 ns | 43.00 (1,000 samples) | 3,247.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Publish-address lookup | 10-byte key, 128 route entries | 100,000 | 14.9 ns | 0.00 (1,000 samples) | 0.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Loopback pending-request completion | 128-byte body over local TCP | 500 | 63,866.0 ns | 77.00 (100 samples) | 9,234.0 (100 samples) |

The sample timing varies from the earlier run while allocation counts and byte
totals match. This is not evidence of a performance regression or improvement.

## Post Producer async executor API revision

Captured with the same command and environment on 2026-10-13 at revision

is not evidence of a performance regression or improvement.

## CheckForbidden error-parity revision

Captured with the same command and environment on 2026-10-14 at revision
`39afef81`. This includes the CheckForbidden retry/error mapping changes. The
measurements remain machine-specific observations, not acceptance thresholds.

## Current Phase 18 code revision

Captured with the reproduction command on 2026-10-16 at code revision
`15c6ca4f` (documentation-only commits follow it). Environment and fixed
inputs match the earlier captures above. This is one same-host sample; timing
is not an acceptance threshold or a cross-machine comparison.

| Operation | Input | Iterations | Time per iteration | Allocation calls per iteration | Allocated bytes per iteration |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Remoting frame encode/decode | 427 encoded frame bytes | 20,000 | 1,932.5 ns | 39.00 (1,000 samples) | 4,612.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Zstd message-record decode | 146 record bytes | 10,000 | 1,162.8 ns | 17.00 (1,000 samples) | 197,493.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Producer send-request construction | 512-byte body | 20,000 | 1,176.4 ns | 54.00 (1,000 samples) | 3,665.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Publish-address lookup | 10-byte key, 128 route entries | 100,000 | 15.1 ns | 0.00 (1,000 samples) | 0.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Loopback pending-request completion | 128-byte body over local TCP | 500 | 59,048.3 ns | 77.00 (100 samples) | 9,234.0 (100 samples) |

The sample meets the Phase 18 offline measurement evidence requirement. Changes
in timing/allocation observations from earlier revisions are recorded without
claiming regression or improvement; this benchmark defines no performance
threshold.

## Remoting custom-header revision — Linux container sample

Captured with the reproduction command on 2026-10-17 at code revision
`b6da737e`. The benchmark ran in the Rust 1.85.0 Bookworm container on Linux
AArch64 with 18 logical CPUs; the container reported only `aarch64` as its
hardware label. This sample is kept separate from the native macOS results
above and must not be compared with them as a performance change.

| Operation | Input | Iterations | Time per iteration | Allocation calls per iteration | Allocated bytes per iteration |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Remoting frame encode/decode | 427 encoded frame bytes | 20,000 | 1,197.1 ns | 40.00 (1,000 samples) | 4,676.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Zstd message-record decode | 146 record bytes | 10,000 | 712.7 ns | 17.00 (1,000 samples) | 197,493.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Producer send-request construction | 512-byte body | 20,000 | 806.0 ns | 54.00 (1,000 samples) | 3,665.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Publish-address lookup | 10-byte key, 128 route entries | 100,000 | 12.2 ns | 0.00 (1,000 samples) | 0.0 (1,000 samples) |
| Loopback pending-request completion | 128-byte body over local TCP | 500 | 5,409.3 ns | 79.00 (100 samples) | 9,442.0 (100 samples) |

These measurements satisfy the current-revision offline benchmark run; they
are observations, not acceptance thresholds. Allocation totals are aggregate
allocator calls and requested bytes divided by sampled operations.

loopback time includes local TCP and Tokio scheduling.

## Current compatibility-closure rerun

Captured with `cargo bench --offline -p rocketmq-classic --bench offline
--locked` on 2026-10-23 at revision `bd2fc5b6966bb9efc0cc1f26e0f9653a5164ff65`.
Environment and fixed inputs match the native macOS samples above. The sample
was taken after the PopProcessQueue facade parity change; the benchmarked
paths do not exercise that API. It is a machine-specific observation, not a
performance threshold or a cross-machine comparison.

operations. Timing varies by run; this table sets no acceptance threshold.
Loopback timing includes local TCP and Tokio scheduling.

Allocation totals are aggregate allocator calls and requested bytes divided by
sampled operations. Timing varies between runs; loopback timing includes local
TCP and Tokio scheduling. The offline benchmark does not measure subtype
dispatch directly.

## Historical benchmark sample after Producer startup-route test checkpoint — 2026-10-22

Captured with `cargo bench -p rocketmq-classic --bench offline --locked` on
code revision `561bae6d`. Its startup transport-error regression asserted lease
rollback at the time; a later pinned Java probe found that assertion differed
from Java, and the corrected behavior is recorded at `4cabbffb`. The measured
operation inputs and outputs below remain a valid single-host observation and
set no threshold. Environment, inputs, and iteration counts match the fixed
fixtures above.

## Signed timeout and MQClientAPI getter parity current-tree sample — 2026-10-23 (`05e51237`)

Captured with `cargo bench --offline -p rocketmq-classic --bench offline
--locked` on code revision `05e51237`, after matching Java's signed synchronous
RPC timeout connection order and exposing the `MQClientAPIImpl` remoting and
live NameServer-list getters. Environment: macOS 26.6.1 AArch64, Apple M5 Max,
