# Plan: Phase 11 — Rebalance and assignment lifecycle

> Parent: [`00-rocketmq-classic-plan.md`](00-rocketmq-classic-plan.md), Phase 11; execution index: [`README.md`](README.md).
> Translation: [`12-phase-11-rebalance.zh-tw.md`](12-phase-11-rebalance.zh-tw.md). This is an implementation plan, not a report of completed or verified implementation.

## Execution contract

- Port **all Java client 5.5.1 settings, features and control flows**, including defaults, validation, callbacks, errors, retries and lifecycle. Map Java source/method/configuration to Rust and unit-test IDs in both directions; no extra public Rust setting/feature and no missing Java client capability. Rust naming/ownership may differ, not observable semantics. Internal test seams stay private.
- Implement the **client only**. Java client 5.5.1 remains the oracle; **RocketMQ server V5_3_4 (5.3.4)** is the production/local Docker baseline, not the client source baseline. A server limitation does not authorize deleting a client feature; compare both clients against the same server and retain source/fixture coverage for unavailable success paths.
- **Phase 0–18 primarily use unit tests**, supplemented by Java golden/offline differential tests and small scripted loopback tests where transport requires them. No live Broker or Docker is a phase prerequisite. Broker, TLS/auth cluster, cross-language, end-to-end and server stress execution belongs to [Phase 19](20-phase-19-docker-local-validation.md); non-local checks become owner-executed manual items there. Phase acceptance is not final compatibility/release acceptance.

## 1. Goal and scope

Complete public Push startup and deterministic queue assignment, including safe queue removal/addition under concurrent pulls and callbacks.

## 2. Prerequisites and current-state analysis

Phase 10 private activation/removal seam and Phase 9 offset-boundary RPCs are ready. Orderly lock-specific integration remains pending until Phase 12; do not advertise orderly ownership yet.

- Read/complete first: [Phase 10](11-phase-10-push-consumer-pipeline.md).

### 2.1 Java references to inspect

- Before coding, resolve these classes/methods and their call sites using the pinned-source rules in the index; the Java artifact has not been independently verified by this planning task.
- `RebalanceImpl`
- `RebalancePushImpl`
- `RebalanceService`
- `AllocateMessageQueueAveragely`
- `AllocateMessageQueueAveragelyByCircle`
- `consistent-hash and machine-room allocation classes`

## 3. Target files and implementation contract

These are proposed paths relative to the repository root, not existing Rust/Java implementation files. Reuse files established by prior phases; do not create parallel implementations.

```text
crates/rocketmq-classic-consumer/src/rebalance/mod.rs
crates/rocketmq-classic-consumer/src/rebalance/strategy/
crates/rocketmq-classic-consumer/src/rebalance/service.rs
crates/rocketmq-classic-consumer/src/push/consumer.rs
crates/rocketmq-classic-consumer/tests/rebalance.rs
examples/push_consumer.rs
```

One rebalance execution mutates a consumer at a time; wakeups coalesce. Sort MessageQueue and client IDs using Java-compatible comparisons before strategy calls. Build desired assignment from a consistent snapshot, then reconcile against current queue generations. A failed consumer-list query is not an authoritative empty group and must not cause arbitrary reassignment. No local state is removed until its ownership/offset obligations are fulfilled.

## 4. Ordered implementation tasks

### 4.1 P11-01 / P11-02 — Implement average allocation as pure logic

Use the master-plan strategy signature and fixture expected errors/empty results for invalid input/current-client-missing cases. Port Java index/start/range arithmetic exactly, including fewer queues than consumers. Test all clients together: assignments are disjoint and cover eligible queues, not just the current client result.

### 4.2 P11-03 — Inventory and implement all Java allocation strategies

Inventory and implement every Java 5.5.1 public allocation strategy, including circle and all source-confirmed consistent-hash/machine-room variants. Match hash bytes, virtual nodes, sorting, defaults and errors. No deferred or excluded strategy is acceptable; unit-test every strategy against Java fixtures.

### 4.3 P11-04 / P11-05 — Resolve clustering and broadcasting assignments

Broadcasting assigns all subscribed queues and uses local offsets. Clustering fetches consumer IDs, sorts them and invokes the selected strategy; distinguish unavailable, empty and missing-current-client results from fixtures. Update subscription snapshots and retry failed fetches on the next owned cycle. Integrate startup step 12 so real rebalance replaces Phase 10 test assignment.

### 4.4 P11-06 — Remove an assignment in ownership order

Mark dropped before cancelling pending pulls; stop new consume work, preserve unresolved offsets and persist safe progress. If cleanup fails, retain removal state for retry rather than deleting evidence. A replacement generation must not receive old listener/pull completion. Install the orderly unlock seam now, activating it in Phase 12. Remove registry state by identity only after cleanup succeeds.

### 4.5 P11-07 — Compute a safe initial offset and activate

Remove stale in-memory offsets only at the Java-defined point, then read the authoritative stored offset. If absent, implement each ConsumeFromWhere policy using Phase 9 RPCs, including retry-topic and timestamp/time-zone behavior captured from Java. Failure to obtain a start offset must not become zero. Create one ProcessQueue generation, activate one PullRequest and roll back if activation fails. Phase 12 inserts Broker locking before orderly activation.

### 4.6 P11-08 / P11-09 — Wire triggers and prove race safety

Own one periodic service with immediate startup, subscription-change and NOTIFY_CONSUMER_IDS_CHANGED wakeups. Use source-confirmed timing and bounded/coalesced signals. Reject work after shutdown begins. Add barrier-driven remove-versus-pull, remove-versus-listener, concurrent-trigger and rapid join/leave tests; finish the real public Push example and facade exports.

## 5. Verification

Write the failing check/oracle fixture before its implementation. The cases below must become runnable checks, not manual checklist-only claims. Run these checks without Docker or a live Broker; use Java fixtures, controlled clocks and scripted peers. Shared commands and evidence rules are in the execution index.

- [x] **P11-V01** — Java/Rust allocations match for 0/1/N queues, 1/N clients, 10q/3c, missing client, Unicode order and every Java strategy.
- [x] **P11-V02** — Initial-offset policies match Java; query/persist failure never resets to zero or removes a live replacement.

- [x] **P11-U01** — Java allocation fixtures, scripted membership changes and barrier tests verify join/leave convergence, startup, retry, safe offsets and shutdown ownership.

### 5.1 Local commands after implementation

The implementation run executed these commands. Detailed outcomes, including
the separate full-Maven fixture drift, are recorded in the [Phase 11 execution
log](../../../rlogs/2026/09/12-phase-11-rebalance__20261012T000155Z.rlog).

```bash
cargo test -p rocketmq-classic-consumer --test rebalance --locked
cargo build -p rocketmq-classic --examples --locked
```

### 5.2 Phase 19 live-test handoff

Retain these case IDs and behavior requirements for Phase 19 execution against Docker server 5.3.4; they are not this phase's pass conditions and must not be marked PASS early.

- [ ] **P11-V03** — Local mixed Java/Rust group join/leave converges within a documented timeout with no persistent duplicate queue ownership; transient redelivery remains allowed.
- [ ] **P11-V04** — Real public Java producer→Rust Push and Rust producer→Java Push paths pass with retries/offsets; repeated shutdown leaves no scheduler tasks.

## 6. Acceptance and handoff

Close the cumulative Phase 10–11 public Push gate. Keep orderly rows PARTIAL until lock renewal, expiry and callback completion fencing are accepted in Phase 12.

- Handoff includes changed paths, case IDs, actual commands/results, fixture provenance and matrix status/gaps; follow the shared rules in the index.
- Next: [Phase 12](13-phase-12-orderly-consumption.md).
