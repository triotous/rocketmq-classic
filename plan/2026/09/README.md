# RocketMQ Classic — Phase Implementation Index

## 1. Scope and verified repository state

This directory expands [the master plan](00-rocketmq-classic-plan.md) into **20 sequential phase plans (Phase 0–19)**, each with an English primary and equivalent Traditional Chinese translation. Numbered filenames `01`–`20` are document numbers; the `phase-00`–`phase-19` components preserve the original phase numbers. The September 2026 directory is intentionally retained from the requested parent plan.

Repository inspection found only the master plan and its SVG diagrams. There is no Cargo workspace, Java harness, source code, dependency lockfile or test suite yet. All source paths, signatures, test targets and commands in the child plans are proposed implementation contracts, not claims about existing code. This planning work did not download/verify the Java release or run client tests. Phase 0 must verify the requested tag `rocketmq-all-5.5.1`, commit `efa1be59d6fc747ad220f036c86030f05f0419f9` and Maven artifact `org.apache.rocketmq:rocketmq-client:5.5.1` before generating authoritative fixtures. Stop for review if they disagree; never silently switch baselines.

The master plan retains overall scope and compatibility definitions. Child plans add task order, concrete mechanics and acceptance evidence; they do not authorize silently dropping features. Original Pn-NN task IDs are preserved, sometimes grouped under one implementation step. Added IDs fill bootstrap/testing/lifecycle gaps. Phase 16–18 task IDs map to the master’s numbered feature sections.

Java client **5.5.1** is the source/behavior baseline; server **V5_3_4 (5.3.4)** is the production and Phase 19 Docker baseline. Implement only the client, not Broker/NameServer/Proxy/store. Server limitations never authorize omitting Java client features; compare both clients on the same server and do not claim complete compatibility without success-path evidence.

## 2. Sequential reading and implementation order

Read the English primary as authoritative; use its paired Chinese file for the same requirements. Finish the current phase’s gate before the next, with the explicit cumulative Push gate described in section 3.

Use a separate branch to distinguish each implementation phase. Commits record incremental work within that phase's branch; a commit is not a phase boundary or proof of phase acceptance. Work may be committed before the phase gate passes, provided its remaining gaps and verification status are stated accurately. Do not mark a phase complete or hand off to the next phase until its acceptance gate passes.

## 3. Dependency clarifications required for sequential work

1. **Bootstrap:** Phase 0 creates only the Java offline oracle/fixtures. Phase 1 creates common/protocol workspace crates; remoting arrives in Phase 2, core in Phase 5; integration infrastructure in Phase 19, producer/facade in Phase 7 and consumer in Phase 8. Do not create empty future crates.
2. **No crate cycle:** HeaderMap, ProtocolError and header conversion traits live in protocol from Phase 2. Remoting uses them; Phase 4 headers never import remoting. Dependency direction remains common ← protocol ← remoting ← core ← producer/consumer ← facade.
3. **Models are not supported APIs:** Phase 4 models and Phase 5 lower-level Lite/POP calls do not imply a public consumer exists. Phase 13 classifies and completes the complete Java public surface.
4. **Message decode:** Phase 5 returns raw pull bytes; Phase 8 supplies the single bounded decoder. Do not duplicate parsing to unblock earlier RPC tests.
5. **Offset dependency:** Phase 9 implements search/min/max/earliest-time primitives needed by Phase 11 start-offset policies; Phase 17 only adds/reuses their Java-equivalent public admin exposure.
6. **Push/rebalance gap:** Phase 10 tests the pipeline through a private assignment seam and test-only fixed assignment. Phase 11 supplies real startup/periodic/notification rebalance and closes the cumulative public Push gate. Do not ship a fake fixed-assignment production Push implementation.
7. **Orderly dependency:** Phase 11 prepares lock-aware lifecycle seams; Phase 12 activates Broker locking/renewal/expiry and orderly callbacks. Until then orderly compatibility is PARTIAL.
8. **Release labels are not phase gates:** Namespace is implemented in Phase 16 despite appearing in the master’s v0.1 matrix. A Phase 7 Producer milestone must not claim that entire release column is complete. TLS starts in Phase 3 and is finalized in Phase 16. All advertised release columns require their actual feature evidence.
9. **Complete parity:** Every Java client 5.5.1 setting, feature and flow is mandatory; no Lite/POP, trace, strategy or admin exclusions and no additional public Rust capability.
10. **Test ownership:** Phase 0–18 primarily use unit tests plus offline golden/differential and necessary scripted peers, without Docker/live Broker prerequisites. All locally executable server/TLS/auth/cross-language/stress tests run in Phase 19; non-local items become owner manual checks.

## 4. Shared implementation and evidence rules

### 4.1 Read the exact Java source

Use the verified checkout/source artifacts recorded in `compat/java-reference/README.md`, never `develop`. Resolve short class references in each phase against:

- `common/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/common/` for messages, flags, namespace and common values;
- `remoting/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/remoting/` for framing, codes, headers and protocol bodies;
- `client/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/client/` for APIs, runtime, Producer, Consumer and allocation behavior;
- additional auth/ACL/trace modules only as located in the verified 5.5.1 source tree.

Record the actual file, method and call site in the compatibility matrix before porting. Inspect both header validation and construction/response interpretation paths. Numbers, defaults, field order, requiredness and serialization limits come from this evidence, not guesses or unrelated SDKs. If a named class/path differs at the verified tag, record the actual mapping and stop for review if behavior is ambiguous.

### 4.2 Implement one reviewable task at a time

1. Read the phase’s prerequisites, contract and linked Java methods.
2. Add the named failing test or Java fixture; link it to the matrix before writing behavior.
3. Make the minimum change in the listed owning files, using standard Rust collections, installed dependencies and existing lower layers first. Add dependencies only when the phase actually uses them.
4. Run focused checks and common gates; keep all earlier suites passing.
5. Update `docs/compatibility/JAVA_5_5_1_COMPATIBILITY.md`, `REQUEST_CODES.md`, `KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md` where applicable and record commands/results in that phase’s implementation handoff/log. Do not invent an extra logging service or framework.
6. Commit reviewable work only under the implementation workflow agreed with the owner. This documentation task itself does not implement, commit, tag or publish software.

No production-input `unwrap`/`expect`, unchecked length allocation, sync guard across await, unowned task, credential logging or silent offset reset. Preserve unknown codes/ext fields. Every retry consumes one original monotonic deadline. Every stateful task/registration has identity-aware rollback, cancellation and join ownership. User callbacks run outside shared locks/readers. Internal optimization notes may name future improvements, but cannot defer any Java setting, feature or observable flow.

Use built-in Rust tests and small table-driven fixtures; a new testing framework is not required. Reuse loopback peers for transport failure simulation. A trait is justified for actual multiple implementations (for example local/remote OffsetStore), not merely to wrap a single concrete service for tests.

### 4.3 Evidence and test commands

Phase-local commands are **to be implemented and run during coding**, not runnable in today’s documentation-only tree. Paths without a leading slash are repository-root-relative.

From Phase 1 onward, run these local gates after every completed phase:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
```

From Phase 0 onward, Java/fixture changes also run:

```bash
mvn -f compat/java-reference/pom.xml verify
python3 tests/differential/compare.py --self-test
```

Phase 0 produces Broker-free Java fixtures; after Phase 2 Maven verify must decode Rust fixtures. Phase 0–18 cargo tests require no server; scripted peers use test-owned loopback sockets/certificates. Register all live scenarios with execution_phase=19 and original case IDs, never reporting PASS early. Phase 19 creates Compose, the integration package, live differential runner and complete local entry point; see [Phase 19](20-phase-19-docker-local-validation.md).

Fixture metadata includes SHA-256, source provenance and separate client/server versions. Never normalize away protocol errors, ordering, retry counts, duplicate relationships or offset advancement. Separate UNIT_VERIFIED from live PENDING_PHASE_19; completion of Phase 18 is not final compatibility or release acceptance.

## 5. Handoff and stop conditions

A phase handoff lists changed files, evidence/test IDs, exact commands and results, actual profile/version, remaining status rows and the next phase. Keep assertions executable and deterministic, including startup failure and terminal-owner race checks. One successful connection is not a compatibility gate.

Stop and request review when the verified baseline disagrees, a field width narrows, Java requiredness/behavior is ambiguous, a completed lower-layer contract must change, ownership cannot be safely transferred or differential results disagree without explanation. Add the failing fixture first; follow the master plan’s ADR rule for lower-layer contract changes rather than silently rewriting earlier phases. Deployment-only checks that have not run remain BLOCKED, never PASS.

## 6. Complete source mapping and owner environment inputs

The Java-to-Rust matrix covers every public method/overload, inherited/deprecated API, configuration (including environment/system properties), default/type/unit/range/validation, control-flow branch, error/callback/retry/lifecycle and unit ID. Reverse-inventory Rust facade/exports/configuration/feature flags so every public feature and setting has a Java counterpart; private test seams must not leak. Phase 18 closes inventory gaps, never counting TODO/PARTIAL or INTENTIONAL_DIFFERENCE as feature completion.

Before Phase 19 manual execution, the owner supplies actual production topology, CA/auth provisioning, authorized disposable resources, maintenance windows and workload/SLO inputs. These are environment inputs, not feature-exclusion decisions. Required unrun non-local checks remain BLOCKED and prevent final approval; locally reproducible checks must execute automatically. Documentation changes do not assert implementation or passing tests.
