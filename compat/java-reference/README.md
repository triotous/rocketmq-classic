# Java 5.5.1 offline compatibility oracle

Phase 5 now persists 148 invoked cases across eight fixture families. The 29 cases in `fixtures/rpc-invoked-pop-ack/` execute POP/POP Lite, ACK/ACK Lite, batch ACK and change-invisibility callbacks; Java encodes an actual message for FOUND, while Rust retains and compares the raw bytes for Phase 8. Missing/invalid primitive POP and change-invisibility response fields retain zero under Java reflective decoding. `rpc_invoked_pop_ack_fixtures.rs` checks request fields, bodies, typed outcomes and response metadata. Maven verify regenerates every family in drift-check mode. SHA-256 verification: `shasum -a 256 -c docs/compatibility/P5_INVOKED_SHA256SUMS.txt`. The method matrix is the current gate inventory.

This standalone Maven project pins `org.apache.rocketmq:rocketmq-client:5.5.1`. The local source checkout was inspected read-only at tag `rocketmq-all-5.5.1`, commit `efa1be59d6fc747ad220f036c86030f05f0419f9` (2026-08-20); the active Java checkout remains unchanged at 5.3.3.

## Verified local artifacts and tools

- Client binary SHA-256: `1c39c94a28e59b292e29d699872d693cdc2ce30bd54c4e0f95a4c377fd9dff84`
- Client source SHA-256: `de63ae377bcc9b461b0d65b4cb77673d9daabb8f46caabef903826ea7c627e76`
- Maven fixture runtime: Maven 3.10.0 with Homebrew OpenJDK 27 on macOS arm64 (2026-10-09). Runtime-generated fixtures record `java.runtime.version` and `java.vendor`; the shell's standalone `java` may use another JDK.
- Full `verify` checks that recorded fixture runtime and its live macOS loopback scope case. Run it with the recorded Maven/JDK/OS when checking the complete fixture set; a different JDK/OS can intentionally report address-fixture drift. On Linux, the `linux-runtime-address-oracle` profile separately checks `address-linux.json` against the pinned Java `NetworkUtil` Linux loopback result.
- Source paths verified in tag: `remoting/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/remoting/protocol/RemotingCommand.java`, `RocketMQSerializable.java`, `RequestCode.java`, `ResponseCode.java`, and `client/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/client/impl/MQClientAPIImpl.java`.
- Maven dependency is pinned and build validation rejects a changed client version. Resolve/check source artifacts with `mvn -f compat/java-reference/pom.xml dependency:sources` when regenerating evidence.

## Commands

```sh
mvn -f compat/java-reference/pom.xml verify
mvn -f compat/java-reference/pom.xml exec:java -Dexec.args='fixtures --output fixtures/remoting'
mvn -f compat/java-reference/pom.xml exec:java -Dexec.args='decode --input fixtures/remoting/route-001-get-existing-topic.bin'
mvn -f compat/java-reference/pom.xml exec:java -Dexec.args='scenario --id HEARTBEAT-001 --output target/heartbeat.json'
python3 tests/differential/compare.py --self-test
mvn -f compat/java-reference/pom.xml exec:java -Dexec.args=invoked-rpc-oracle
mvn -f compat/java-reference/pom.xml exec:java -Dexec.args="runtime-address-fixtures $(pwd)/fixtures/runtime/address.json"
```

`runtime-address-fixtures` records 42 numeric address helper cases, a named IPv6 scope created from a live loopback `NetworkInterface`, 49 direct endpoint-split outcomes, all 65,536 BMP UTF-16 host code units, all 1,112,064 Unicode scalar host values, all 65,536 socket ports, and every BMP code unit tested by `Integer.parseInt`. Maven `verify` runs the generator in drift-check mode.

The fixture command emits offline Remoting command frames (no live Broker). A frame is accompanied by JSON with version provenance, scenario, request code, decoded semantic fields, body length, full-frame SHA-256 and the command used to generate it. Live scenarios in `tests/differential/scenarios.yaml` explicitly remain `PENDING_PHASE_19`; command-frame fixtures are not claims of successful Broker operations.

## Phase 5 offline reply differential

Run `compat/java-reference/run-rpc-differential.sh` from any directory. It regenerates 15 deterministic Java 5.5.1 response frames under `fixtures/rpc/`, decodes them in the Rust typed-header test, emits Rust frames under `target/p5-rust-rpc-frames/`, and uses the pinned Java decoder to check response code, response flag, ext fields and body bytes. `cargo test -p rocketmq-classic-core --test rpc_java_fixtures --locked` also checks the checked-in evidence without Maven. The labeled outcomes follow `MQClientAPIImpl.processSendResponse`, `processPullResponse`, and `queryConsumerOffset` in pinned source; they are not executions of those methods. `server_baseline_not_contacted` explicitly denotes no server interaction.

Frame coverage: send (four status codes), pull (four status codes with raw FOUND bytes), query offset (success and not-found), unknown send code, route error, and missing success headers. These frame fixtures do not exercise `MQClientAPIImpl` and are not P5-U01 or P5-V01 completion claims; keep Phase 19 cases pending.

The complete invoked corpus spans route, producer variants, ordinary/Lite pull, offsets, list/send-back, lock/unlock, heartbeat V1/V2, unregister, assignment/request mode, Lite subscription, POP/POP Lite, ACK/ACK Lite, batch ACK and change-invisibility. It contains 148 cases across eight families; Maven verify checks deterministic regeneration and core `rpc_invoked*_fixtures.rs` tests compare the same requests and domain outcomes through scripted peers. P5-U01/V01/V03 are locally verified at the Phase 5 raw-message boundary; the full bidirectional method and branch inventory is in `docs/compatibility/PHASE_5_OFFLINE_METHOD_MATRIX.md`. Java ASYNC completion maps to Rust Future results; synchronous wait expiry and pending cleanup remain separate, covered by `rpc_modes.rs` and transport pending tests.

The separate `invoked-rpc-oracle` command (also run by Maven `test`) executes pinned `MQClientAPIImpl` with an injected mock `RemotingClient`. It asserts send V2 oneway, synchronous send statuses (success, disk/slave timeout, slave unavailable) and broker error, async send success/error callbacks driven by the mock, reply V2 and batch oneway dispatch, pull synchronous statuses (found, not found, retry, moved) and broker error, and async pull callbacks for all four statuses, broker error and transport failure. It also checks query-offset success, `OffsetNotFoundException` and generic broker error; update-offset sync success/error and oneway; heartbeat and unregister success/error; route decoded success and topic-not-exist; lock success/error, unlock sync success/error and oneway; consumer send-back success/error; request-mode success/error; consumer-list populated and empty success, absent-body success (throws), and broker error; assignment empty and populated success/error; heartbeat V2 ext-field success, absent-field defaults and error; end-transaction oneway; and POP, POP Lite, ACK, ACK Lite, batch ACK and change-invisibility async dispatch and success/error callbacks. The change-invisibility callback decodes the response header before inspecting its status; absent primitive header fields decode as zero on both success and error. Request codes, transport modes, selected headers/bodies and return values are checked at invocation. ACK Lite actually dispatches `ACK_MESSAGE` (200051), not `ACK_LITE_MESSAGE` (200072). No Broker or NameServer is contacted. This command writes no fixture files; the 15 response frames and their `java_outcome` labels remain source-derived, not executed method results. Pinned `MQClientAPIImpl.sendMessage` returns `SendResult` for SYNC and `null` for ASYNC, not a future. Pinned 5.5.1 `MQClientAPIImpl` has no `notificationAsync`, `pollingInfoAsync`, or dedicated ACK Lite request-code method; these cannot be invoked through this API. Lite subscription control is implemented by pinned `MQClientAPIExt.syncLiteSubscriptionAsync` rather than `MQClientAPIImpl`; its three persisted cases compare request/response/outcome but do not establish identical async API behavior. The complete 148-case corpus and branch audit now close P5-U01 within the Phase 5 scope; see the method matrix for exact evidence and later-phase ownership. No server behavior is tested.
